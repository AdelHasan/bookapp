      <h1>About This Project</h1>
      <p>
      This project was built as my second project during my Software Engineering Immersive cohort at General Assembly. The project was built with React, React Router, and Bootstrap. It uses requests to the Google Books API, and allows users to save links to books to a reading list for future reference.

        My vision for the use of the App became clearer after building out the core functionality. As it functions now, I can see myself keeping a browser tab open with this app to quickly generate a collection of reading material on a topic I wish to dive deep into. Hence the name "Reasearch Launchpad", I think this app can function as a unique starting point for researching topics.
